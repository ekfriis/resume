## Summary

I'm a technologist that likes to build things that have value.  I have spent most of my career building tools and platforms to increase the impact of research projects by turning them into into production-grade systems that are simple, reliable, and grow with grace.  I think software is more fun when it's purpose is clear, and simple, clean, and performant.  Design docs in the streets, low level optimization in the sheets.

## Work Experience

#### Google 2013 - present (Los Angeles, CA)

Senior Staff Software Engineer

- Assistant NLU Platform Infrastructure (2020 - present)

  - Tech lead for new Assistant multi-tenant platform to un-spaghettify Natural Language Understanding
  - Factored advanced NLU retrieval algorithms into simple microservice building blocks to improve reliability, reusability, and developer velocity.
  - Designed and built a friendly platform and clean APIs to enable NLU development by regular SWEs instead of linguists (a bottleneck).
  - Worked closely with researchers in NLP (who need to innovate) and engineers in Assistant feature teams (who need to ship stuff) to build a platform .
  - Scaled system from zero to 30+ client teams serving 30k QPS.
  - Currently a lead architect on efforts to leverage LLMs to improve Assistant.

- Google Insights Finder (2013-2020)
  - Backend tech lead for a consumer insights product used by sales and large Google advertisers.
  - Turned ad-hoc, highly curated sales analyses into a low-latency, customer-facing production system, by building:
    - pipelines that indexed petabytes of Google user data,
    - distributed backend system to query, aggregate, and describe arbitrary groups of users from a 3B user corpus with sub-second latency,
    - algorithms and classifiers to ensure and monitor user privacy, safety, and brand suitability,
    - and a pipeline that indexed Google query time-series data to identify category trends.
  - Worked with product, go-to-market teams, and external customers to learn their problems first hand.
  - Using user data for advertising is a challenging ethical, privacy, and policy problem.  Worked across product-areas to build systems that would convince data owners, legal, public relations, and privacy stakeholders.

#### University of Wisconsin, Madison Researcher 2011 - 2013 (Wisconsin & Geneva, Switzerland)

Postdoc on CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider

-  Maintained Wisconsin's FPGA-based Regional Calorimeter Trigger .
-  Designed new algorithms and control systems for trigger upgrade, based on Microblaze FPGA platform.
-  Built data analysis platform to support UW group's physics analyses of LHC data, used by group for 7 years after I left.
-  Analyst and editor for the Vector-Boson + Higgs search publications.
-  Author (among many) on Higgs Boson discovery paper.
-  Convener of Tau Physics Object Group, organizing contributions and efforts across multiple universities and labs.

## Education 

 - 2011 - Ph.D. in Experimental High-Energy Particle physics. UC Davis
   - Thesis: Search for Neutral MSSM Higgs Bosons Decaying to Pairs of Tau Leptons at âˆš7 TeV
 - 2005 - B.S. in Physics, UC San Diego

## Skills

 - Have written/read a lot of C++.  200k LOC of changes at Google, code reviewer for 570k.
 - C++ Readability (Google styleguide) volunteer mentor, reviewed over 2000 changelists (pull requests).
 - Fluent in MapReduce, Go, Python, SQL, and Pandas.
 - Making APIs that are fun to use, distributed system design, production monitoring.
 - Turning big dumpster fires into many smaller dumpsters, and only a few of them are on fire.
