## Summary

I'm a technologist that likes to build things that have value, whether that is high-level design and APIs, or hyperoptimizing the hot path. I’ve spent my career building tools and platforms that increase the impact of prototypes/research projects by turning them into production-grade systems that are simple, reliable, and grow with grace. I think technical leaders make better decisions when they are close enough to the code to smell it, and that software is more fun when its purpose is clear, and the code is simple, clean, and performant.

## Work Experience

#### Google 2013 - present (Los Angeles, CA)

Senior Staff Software Engineer (2022-Present)  
Staff Software Engineer (2020-2022)  
Senior Software Engineer (2017-2020)  

- Google Assistant, NLU Platform Infrastructure (2020 - present)
  - Tech lead for new Assistant multi-tenant platform to un-spaghettify Natural Language Understanding (NLU).
  - Scaled system from zero to 30+ client teams serving 30k QPS.
  - Factored advanced NLU retrieval algorithms into simple microservice building blocks to improve reliability, reusability, and developer velocity.
  - Designed and built a friendly platform and clean APIs to enable NLU development by regular SWEs instead of linguists, removing a years-long staffing bottleneck.  Worked with NLP researchers to enable innovation (and fold winning ideas into the platform).
  - Lead infrastructure architect on efforts to leverage LLMs to improve Assistant by enabling LLM-driven composition of existing features to enable new user journeys.
  - Business impact: simplification and consolidation have driven quality and latency wins across many assistant features, semantic APIs are enabling new LLM integrations.

- Google Insights Finder (2013-2020)
  - Backend tech lead for a consumer insights product used by internal sales teams and large Google advertisers and marketers.
  - Turned ad-hoc sales analyses into a low-latency, customer-facing production system by building pipelines that indexed petabytes of Google user data and a distributed backend to query, aggregate, and describe arbitrary groups of users from a 3B user corpus with sub-second latency.
  - Worked with product, go-to-market, and external customers to learn their problems and underlying needs firsthand.
  - Worked across product areas to build state-of-the-art anonymization and brand safety algorithms and systems that would convince data owners, legal, public relations, and privacy stakeholders that we could create advertiser utility from user data safely and ethically.
  - Business impact: Insights used in $3B+ ARR of Google advertising campaigns, highest CSAT (90%) of all Google sales tools.  

#### University of Wisconsin, Madison
Postdoctoral Researcher 2011 - 2013 (Wisconsin & Geneva, Switzerland)

Postdoc on Large Hadron Collider at CERN (CMS Experiment)

-  Author (among many) on Higgs Boson discovery paper, editor for the Vector-Boson Higgs search.
-  Designed embedded algorithms and control systems for calorimeter trigger, based on the Microblaze FPGA platform.
-  Built a data analysis platform to support UW’s physics analyses of LHC data, used by the group for 7 years after I left.
-  Convener of Tau Physics Object Group, organizing efforts across multiple universities and labs.

## Education 

 - 2011 - Ph.D. in Experimental High-Energy Particle Physics, UC Davis
   - Thesis: Search for Neutral MSSM Higgs Bosons Decaying to Pairs of Tau Leptons.
   - Developed a novel geometric dynamical likelihood algorithm for reconstructing Higgs Boson mass in Tau decays.
 - 2005 - B.S. in Physics, UC San Diego

## Skills

 - Fluent in C++, Python, Go, SQL, Pandas.
 - Petabyte scale ETL pipelines. Contributed library that makes doing complex “side-lookup” data joins easy and performant, used by hundreds of pipelines across all Google product areas. 
 - Have written/read a lot of C++. 200k LOC of changes at Google, code reviewer for 570k. Readability (styleguide) volunteer mentor, reviewed over 2000 changelists (pull requests).
 - Making APIs that are fun to use, distributed system design, production monitoring, differential privacy, data visualization.
 - Optimized lots of Google C++ and Go code and saved 10k+ cores.
 - Turning big dumpster fires into many smaller dumpsters, and only a few of them are on fire.
