## Summary

I'm a technologist that likes to build things that have value. I have spent most of my career building tools and platforms that increase the impact of research projects by turning them into into production-grade systems that are simple, reliable, and grow with grace. I like to work on the problems that bring value, whether that is high-level design and APIs, or hyperoptimzing the hot path. I think technical leaders make better decisions when they are close enough to the code to smell it, and that software is more fun when its purpose is clear, and the code is simple, clean, and performant.

## Work Experience

#### Google 2013 - present (Los Angeles, CA)

Senior Staff Software Engineer (2022), Staff Software Engineer (2020), Senior Software Engineer (2017)

- Assistant NLU Platform Infrastructure (2020 - present)
  - Tech lead for new Assistant multi-tenant platform to un-spaghettify Natural Language Understanding.
  - Factored advanced NLU retrieval algorithms into simple microservice building blocks to improve reliability, reusability, and developer velocity.
  - Designed and built a friendly platform and clean APIs to enable NLU development by regular SWEs instead of linguists (a bottleneck).
  - Collaborated with NLP researchers and Assistant feature engineers to design a platform balancing research flexibility with development simplicity and stability.
  - Scaled system from zero to 30+ client teams serving 30k QPS.
  - Currently a lead architect on efforts to leverage LLMs to improve Assistant.

- Google Insights Finder (2013-2020)
  - Backend tech lead for a consumer insights product used by sales and large Google advertisers.
  - Turned ad-hoc, highly curated sales analyses into a low-latency, customer-facing production system, by building:
    - pipelines that indexed petabytes of Google user data,
    - a distributed backend to query, aggregate, and describe arbitrary groups of users from a 3B user corpus with sub-second latency,
    - algorithms and classifiers to ensure user privacy, safety, and brand suitability,
    - and a pipeline that indexed Google query time-series data to identify category trends.
  - Worked with product, go-to-market teams, and external customers to learn their problems first hand.
  - Using user data for advertising is a challenging ethical, privacy, and policy problem.  Worked across product-areas to build systems that would convince data owners, legal, public relations, and privacy stakeholders.

#### University of Wisconsin, Madison Researcher 2011 - 2013 (Wisconsin & Geneva, Switzerland)

Postdoc on CMS experiment at the Large Hadron Collider

-  Maintained Wisconsin's FPGA-based Regional Calorimeter Trigger.
-  Designed new algorithms and control systems for trigger upgrade, based on Microblaze FPGA platform.
-  Built data analysis platform to support UW group's physics analyses of LHC data, used by group for 7 years after I left.
-  Analyst and editor for the Vector-Boson + Higgs search publications.
-  Author (among many) on Higgs Boson discovery paper.
-  Convener of Tau Physics Object Group, organizing contributions and efforts across multiple universities and labs.

## Education 

 - 2011 - Ph.D. in Experimental High-Energy Particle physics. UC Davis
   - Thesis: Search for Neutral MSSM Higgs Bosons Decaying to Pairs of Tau Leptons at âˆš7 TeV.
   - Developed new dynamical likelihood algorithm for reconstructing Higgs Boson mass in Tau decays.
 - 2005 - B.S. in Physics, UC San Diego

## Skills

 - Have written/read a lot of C++.  200k LOC of changes at Google, code reviewer for 570k.
 - C++ Readability (Google styleguide) volunteer mentor, reviewed over 2000 changelists (pull requests).
 - Fluent in MapReduce, Go, Python, SQL, and Pandas.
 - Making APIs that are fun to use, distributed system design, production monitoring.
 - Optimized lots of Google C++ and Go code and saved 10k+ cores.
 - Turning big dumpster fires into many smaller dumpsters, and only a few of them are on fire.
