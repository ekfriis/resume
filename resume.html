<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>I’m a technologist that likes to build things that have value, whether that is high-level design and APIs, or hyperoptimizing the hot path. I’ve spent my career building tools, teams, and platforms that increase the impact of prototypes/research projects by turning them into production-grade systems that are simple, reliable, and grow with grace. I think technical leaders make better decisions and build happier teams when they are close enough to the code to smell it, and that software is more fun when its purpose is clear, and the code is simple, clean, and performant.</p>

<h3 id="google-2013-present-los-angeles">Google <span class="small-text">(2013-Present, Los Angeles)</span></h3>
<p>Senior Staff Software Engineer (2022-Present)<br />
Staff Software Engineer (2020-2022)<br />
Senior Software Engineer (2017-2020)</p>
<h4 id="google-assistant-nlu-platform-infrastructure-2020-present">Google Assistant, NLU Platform Infrastructure <span class="small-text">(2020-Present)</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Tech lead for a multi-tenant platform that un-spaghettifed Assistant Natural Language Understanding (NLU).</li>
<li>Scaled NLU platform from zero to 30+ client teams serving 30k QPS, leading the NLU piece of a multi-year Assistant-wide initiative to migrate all feature code behind well-defined APIs.</li>
<li>Factored advanced NLU retrieval algorithms into simple microservice building blocks to improve reliability, data security, reusability, and developer velocity.</li>
<li>Built a friendly platform and clean APIs to enable NLU development by regular SWEs instead of linguists, removing a years-long staffing bottleneck.</li>
<li>Worked with NLU researchers to enable experimentation within a principled platform, and a path to bring winning ideas into production without creating tech debt.</li>
<li>Infrastructure tech lead on efforts to leverage LLMs to improve Assistant. Successfully shifted entire Assistant organization strategy and roadmap to enable LLMs to interface with existing APIs to cut months off the launch timeline.</li>
<li>As TL and interim manager, I built a happy, chill culture of excellence and developed successful ICs. 75% of the ICs on my teams have been promoted thus far for work I supervised, and only two team members have departed in the last 10 years.</li>
<li>Business impact: simplification and consolidation have driven CSAT and latency wins across many features, Assistant is a cornerstone of new Google hardware launches, and semantic APIs are enabling new LLM integrations.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="google-insights-finder-2013-2020">Google Insights Finder <span class="small-text">(2013-2020)</span></h4>
<ul>
<li>Backend tech lead for a consumer insights product used by internal sales teams and large Google advertisers and marketers.</li>
<li>Scaled custom data science sales analyses that were key revenue drivers for the highest-spend customers by building an interactive, low-latency, customer-facing production system by building pipelines that continuously indexed petabytes of Google user data and a distributed backend to query, aggregate, and describe arbitrary groups of users from a 3B user corpus with sub-second latency.</li>
<li>Scaled large pipeline (4PB of shuffle) from monthly releases with manual QA to daily automated pushes via optimization, incremental updates, and development of automated data quality measurements.</li>
<li>Worked with product, go-to-market, and external customers to learn their problems and underlying needs firsthand.</li>
<li>Built state-of-the-art anonymization and brand safety algorithms and systems.</li>
<li>Led the external launch of Insights Finder to advertisers, previously an internal tool that relied on sales people to intermediate and sanitize the results. External usage of Insights Finder is still growing 75% YoY.</li>
<li>Persuaded leadership stakeholders including data owners, product, legal, public relations, and privacy that the external launch of Insight Finder would create advertiser utility from user data safely and ethically.</li>
<li>Business impact: Insights used in $3B+ ARR of Google advertising campaigns, highest CSAT (90%) of all Google sales tools. Insights Finder was used to help pick the cast of the Dune movie!</li>
